		<p>The types of service dogs I train are primarily psychiatric and any type of service dog who uses scent (allergy, diabetes, etc.). There are two ways I can help you with getting a service dog. I can provide a fully-trained service dog, or if you are local to the Springfield, IL area, I can help you choose and/or train a dog for service work. Please note that while I do participate in barn hunt and nosework, I do not train them. I can point you in the direction of the wonderful trainers I work with for these sports if you are interested.</p>
		
		<p>If you aren't sure if a service dog is right for you, or if you know you want a service dog, but aren't sure if a fully-trained dog or training the dog yourself is the better choice for you, please contact me! I am happy to help give you the pros and cons of each option, and see what works better for you. I'm here to help, I've been where you are.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h2 id="fully_trained" class="dk_purple_bg">Get a Fully-Trained Service Dog</h2>
		<p>The first option I offer is to provide a fully-trained service dog. I will care for and train the dog until they are ready to work (usually around the age of two). In that time I will work with you to determine what tasks would be the most effective for you and train these tasks in the dog. I also make sure the dog is socialized and comfortable around other dogs, cats, and all types of people. When the dog is ready to work, I will deliver the dog to you and work with you for several days to a week to help you learn the dog's tasks and adjust to having a service dog by your side.</p>
		
		<p>Please contact me to discuss the price of this option if you are interested. This also covers a number of supplies that will be delivered with the dog, including leash, collar, vest with patches, at least a week's supply of food, and a toy or two that the dog is particularly fond of. This amount can be paid over a period of time, but must be fully paid before I deliver the dog. If, within the first 6 months, the dog does not work out, you have the option of either returning the dog for a refund or returning the dog for another fully-trained dog. Beyond 6 months, if the dog does not work out, the only guaranteed option is returning the dog for another fully-trained dog. (In certain circumstances, a refund may be possible, I am willing to discuss things and work with you.)</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h2 id="help_training" class="dk_green_bg">Get Help Training a Dog</h2>
		<p>If you live in or near the Springfield, IL area, I can also help you train a dog that you have. This includes everything from picking a dog with the right personality, helping decide what tasks the dog should do, training the actual tasks, training the dog etiquette for being in public, anything that is needed.</p>

		<p>Helping to choose a dog with the right personality is no charge. All other rates are $40 an hour or $20 for a half hour. I will work with you as much as is needed to get the dog ready to work. Please do note that this option requires much more work on your part - I will generally work with you and your dog once a week to once a month depending on what stage of training you and the dog are at, and  you will have things to practice in between training sessions.</p>
