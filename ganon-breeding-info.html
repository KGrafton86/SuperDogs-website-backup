		<p class="breeding-info">Female must have no common ancestors going back at least 4 generations, 5 or more is preferable.</p>
		<p class="breeding-info">Ganon comes from a line of well-trained and well-tested labradors. His sire held both UKC SHR and AKC CGC titles. His dam did not compete, but three of her four grandparents were titled, including AKC Master Hunter, UKC Hunting Retriever Champion, and UKC Upland Hunter. His granddam trained as a Search and Rescue dog specializing in non-discriminating air scent work, so scent work is in his blood. His grandsire holds titles in United Rally Obedience, and both CGC-A (advanced) & CGC-U (urban). His pedigree includes both Field and Bench style Labrador Retrievers; Ganon has the drive of the Field type with the laid-back attitude of the Bench type. He has a solid "off switch", but knows when it is time to go to work and does so with gusto!</p>

		<h3 id="vet" class="lt_green_bg">Vet Info</h3>
		<p class="breeding-info">Most recent checkup May 2020 at Coble Animal Hospital in Springfield, IL. Passed every health exam with flying colors. Cleared by veterinarian to both breed and work.</p>
		<p class="breeding-info"><strong>Vaccinations:</strong> Rabies, parvovirus, bordetella, leptospirosis, canine influenza, and distemper vaccines up to date as of May 2020. Brucellosis test will be performed prior to first breeding. A negative Brucellosis test result (date within the previous 30 days) is required for all females.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3 id="titles" class="lt_green_bg">Titles</h3>
		<p class="breeding-info">RATO (barn hunt open)</p>
		<p class="breeding-info">NACSW Nosework ORT (odor recognition test) passed, waiting for a slot in a level 1 trial</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3 id="other_work" class="lt_green_bg">Other Work</h3>
		<p class="breeding-info">Trained as a service dog in case Pepper ever can't work or can't be with me for some reason</p>
		<p class="breeding-info">Training for search and rescue - human remains detection, live find, and disaster search</p>
		<p class="breeding-info">Completed an ecological research job in Fall 2020 where we conducted wildlife surveys. This requires him to regularly and quickly learn new scents. This contract was searching for birds and bats killed at wind turbines, there is the potential of more work in following years.</p>
		<p class="breeding-info">We do a number of public events such as college welcome weeks, talks and demonstrations at schools, scout groups, etc. At the most recent event at a school (K-8), he worked scent in a room with several hundred people and maintained his focus. After the event he was literally swarmed by kids wanting to pet him following the demonstration, and he was a perfect gentleman. I couldn't have asked for him to handle it any better. He very happily let everyone pet him and give him treats while I answered questions.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3 id="drive" class="lt_green_bg">Drive</h3>
		<p class="breeding-info">Ganon loves scent work more than anything; he will scent <em>anything</em> you give him. I have literally taken a friend's chihuahua, shown her to Ganon to sniff, hid her in a kitchen drawer, and he sniffed her out asleep in the towels. Because he knows how to learn new scents and loves the work, he can be trained on a new scent in a very short perios of time.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3 id="physical_traits" class="lt_green_bg">Physical Traits</h3>

		<p class="breeding-info">Deep-chested.</p>
		<p class="breeding-info">Really long legs.</p>
		<p class="breeding-info">Athletic. Muscular but not bulky. Can climb a pile of rubble or run up a steep hill as easily as he can walk on solid ground.</p>
		<p class="breeding-info">Strong stamina. He can work scenting for hours and not slow down until I make him take a break.</p>
		<p class="breeding-info">Thick, shiny, double coat.</p>
		<p class="breeding-info">Healthy teeth and gums. Received the best possible health rating at most recent vet visit.</p>
		<p class="breeding-info">"Otter" tail.</p>

		<p class="breeding-info">Brown eyes, two slightly different shades (checked by vet, no medical problems). Droopy bottom eyelids, causing no medical issues (negative for both entropion and ectropion), and he uses them to his psychological advantage.</p>

		<p class="breeding-info">Very tolerant, will put up with whatever shennanigans kids and other animals, even young kids and animals, throw at him.</p>
		<p class="breeding-info">Alert. Protective. Attentive.</p>
		<p class="breeding-info">Snuggly. Sometimes overly friendly. Like your typical Labrador, Ganon knows no strangers.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3 id="breeding_method" class="lt_green_bg">Breeding Method & Price</h3>
		<p class="breeding-info">You are welcome to either send the female in heat to me for natural breeding, or I can send semen (frozen or fresh chilled) for artificial insemination through a canine reproductive specialist.</p>
		<p class="breeding-info">Since he is just starting breeding, I'm only charging $800 for a breeding with him (plus the cost of semen collection if you would prefer artificial insemination). If you are interested in a breeding with Ganon, please contact me at the information below.</p>
